# Stormworks career setter
##So you nolonger have to know LUA to set the career settings of your choice

##LINK ##

Ever since 1.0, they removed the interface for changing what settings you want to run your career in. Instead they moved it over to be accessed using LUA.
I don't think that's a fair treatment to give your users who have paid for a product, to hide such an essential feature you can change inside code.
This website will allow you to generate a settings XML you can import to your game to play with these settings.

Not sponsored by Stormworks and will remove repo if the developers of Stormworks wishes so.
